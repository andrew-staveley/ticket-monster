# ticket-monster

Ticket Monster is a python based CLI program that utilizes object-relational mapping frameworks
to interact with a database that stores information.

Ticket Monster is an application designed to allow for a simple way to keep track of tickets and tasks.
It's initially set up for a corporate environment where submitting tickets is required.
It allows for an administrator to view and resolve tickets, as well as update the employee and
issue databases. For a user, it allows a user to create a new ticket for themselves or resolve their own tickets.
